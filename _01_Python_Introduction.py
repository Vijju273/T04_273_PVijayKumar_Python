'''Python Introduction:
=================
1. Tell me about Python?
------------------------------
Guido Van Rossum developed PYTHON Scripting language at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Netherlands in 1989 and it available to the public in 1991.
Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Why Python is so popular now a days?
---------------------------------------------
Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.
Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Features of Python
-------------------------
1. Easy to learn
2. Easy to read
3. Easy to maintain
4. Abroad standard library
5. Interactive mode
6. Portable
7. Python is interpreted
8. Python is object oriented
--------------------------------

4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Python
-----------------------------------------------
Advantages of python
     1. It is easy to learn and use, and it has an extensive library.
     2. Python increases productivity.
     3. It is very flexible.
     4. It has a very supportive community.

Disadvantages of python
     1. Because of its elementary programming, users face difficulty while working with other programming languages.
     2. Python is a time-consuming language. It has a low execution speed.
     3. There are many issues with the design of  the language, which only gets displayed during runtime.
     4. It is not suited for memory-intensive programs and mobile applications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Interpreted vs Compiled time programming languages. Explain in detail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile time: It is the period when the programming code is converted to machine code.
Runtime: It is the  when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. .py vs .pyc files
---------------------------
.py files contain the source code of a program,
whereas .pyc file contains the byte code of your program.
------------------------------------------------------------

7. How compilation will happen internally. Explain in detail
-------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1:  The python compiler reads a python source code or instruction. Then it verifies that the instruction is well-formatted,
i.e. it checks the syntax of each line. If it encounters an error, it immediately halts the translation and shows an error message.

Step 2: If there is no error, i.e. if the python instruction or source code is well-formatted then the compiler translates it into its equivalent form in an intermediate language called “Byte code”.

Step 3: Byte code is then sent to the Python Virtual Machine(PVM) which is the python interpreter. PVM converts the python byte code into machine-executable code. If an error occurs during this interpretation then the conversion is halted with an error message
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Why Python is Dynamically typed programming Language. Explain
-------------------------------------------------------------------
We don't have to declare the type of variable while assigning a value to a variable in Python. Other languages like C, C++, Java, etc..,
there is a strict declaration of variables before assigning values to them. It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. So, Python is a dynamically typed language
-----------------------------------------------

9. Python is Platform independent. Explain
--------------------------------------------
Python programs are platform independent because they can be run on different platforms using an interpreter built specifically for that platform.
